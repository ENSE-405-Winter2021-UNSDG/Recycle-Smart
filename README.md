  <h3 align="center">Recycle Smart</h3>

 This is a proof of concept application that will establish and strengthen our current understanding of the sustainability goal 12 that the United Nations have provided. 
Targeting the sub goals: 

12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse

12.8: By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature

 The lack of relevant information about recycling is not being consumed enough resulting in poor recycling habits around the world. The lack of proper of recycling habits results in overflow in landfills, increase of pollution, and destruction of natural habitats. The application I plan to develop focuses on providing the user with the relevant knowledge of recycling in a form of a mobile application. This way users can learn about recycling materials, recycling symbols and locate nearby recycling centers/disposal centers locally on the go. With the relevant knowledge and the tools provided in this application it will help establish and strengthen the userâ€™s recycling habit.
