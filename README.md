  <h3 align="center">Recycle Smart</h3>

  <p align="center">
 The lack of relevant information about recycling is not being consumed enough resulting in poor recycling habits around the world. The lack of proper of recycling habits results in overflow in landfills, increase of pollution, and destruction of natural habitats. The application I plan to develop focuses on providing the user with the relevant knowledge of recycling in a form of a mobile application. This way users can learn about recycling materials, recycling symbols and locate nearby recycling centers/disposal centers locally. With the relevant knowledge and the tools provided in this application it will help establish and strengthen the userâ€™s recycling habit.

# Reason 
As humans it is only natural to sustain life on earth as much as possible, though in many cases we have not taken account for responsible consumption. Many people are unaware that the products they consume in their life can be disposed of through recycling but this activity is often neglected. This causes harm to our environment causing pollutants to rise in the water and onto land which further disrupts other habitats in our world.
