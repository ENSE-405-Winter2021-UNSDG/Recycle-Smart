# Sustainable-Development
ENSE 405 Project. Creating a application for one of the United Nations 17 Goals of Sustainable Development.
# Project Idea
This application will support the United Nations Goal Responsible Consumption and Production(12). This application will serve as an everyday educational tool for the community to understand what items are recyclable, information about the recyclable symbols, and where locally they can dispose of items.
# Reason 
As humans it is only natural to sustain life on earth as much as possible, though in many cases we have not taken account for responsible consumption. Many people are unaware that the products they consume in their life can be disposed of through recycling but this activity is often neglected which causes harm to our environment causing pollutants to rise in the water and onto land which further disrupts other habitats in our world. 
Building an application that will help identify items recyclability by having it interactable scan and pattern match recyclable symbol via the phone camera or through a quick search which will help consumers recycle items properly.
# Who (Community)
My target audience are the citizens of countries that have trouble with properly disposing waste. The opinions of everyone matters because recycling is a worldwide effort. I want my work to reach the young community as they can become educated about proper waste disposal since many of them may have access to mobile devices. With the information outputted through the mobile phones the users will have access to readily available information. With the constraints of mobile data and or WIFI access.
