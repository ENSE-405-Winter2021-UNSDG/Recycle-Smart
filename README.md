# Sustainable-Development
ENSE 405 Project. Creating a application for one of the United Nations 17 Goals of Sustainable Development.
# Project Idea
This application will enforce and  strengthen our current understanding of the sustainability goal that the United Nations have provided. 

Targeting the sub goals: 

12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse

12.8: By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature

This application will have the interactive ability to allow the user to scan recyclable symbols(0 to 7) to obtain information of the waste material. As well as determining locally where they will be able to dispose the waste materials by using the waste wizard API.  This tool will hopefully help inform people about sustainability and how the affects of proper waste disposal in the long term benefit our world by reducing our carbon footprint.
# Reason 
As humans it is only natural to sustain life on earth as much as possible, though in many cases we have not taken account for responsible consumption. Many people are unaware that the products they consume in their life can be disposed of through recycling but this activity is often neglected. This causes harm to our environment causing pollutants to rise in the water and onto land which further disrupts other habitats in our world. 

Building an application that will help identify items recyclability by having it interactable scan and pattern match recyclable symbol via the phone camera or through a quick search which will help consumers recycle items properly.

# Impact
The application I am developing will not change our current reality but only enforce and strengthen our current understanding of the idea of sustainability in terms of properly disposing waste material. This application will target every citizen in the country who have access to a mobile device as it will provide them with information and a tool to help properly dispose of their waste material locally.

# Who (Community)
My target audience are the citizens of countries that have trouble with properly disposing waste. The opinions of everyone matters because recycling is a worldwide effort. I want my work to reach the young community as they can become educated about proper waste disposal since many of them may have access to mobile devices. With the information outputted through the mobile phones the users will have access to readily available information. With the constraints of mobile data and or WIFI access.

North star customer: Students (Elementary to post-secondary). This is because forming a good recycling habit will help in the long term of disposing waste material correctly.

Carry over customers: Parents/Teachers: Everyone is responsible for recycling their own recyclable materials, parents or teachers can help their children form a good recycling habit while strengthening their own recycling habit.

# What 
The constraints for this project are:

Scanning the recyclable symbol if the waste material is translucent thus the camera will not be able to detect it.

Giving access to information without any cellular data and or internet connection.

The inability to allow people who do not have access to a mobile device receive any information.

The time to develop this application is around ~2 to 3 months.
